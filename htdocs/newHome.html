    The below charts give a campus-wide usage and cost breakdown 
    for Western's electric and steam utilities for the current year. They compare electric 
    and steam data as parts of a whole. Mouse over a section of the pie 
    chart to see what percentages each utility adds to the whole. 
    Electric use has been converted from kWh to BTU for this comparison.
